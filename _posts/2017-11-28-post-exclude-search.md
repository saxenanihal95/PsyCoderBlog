An Activity can be understood as a screen that performs a very particular action in an
Android application (for example, we use an Activity to log in or to modify our profile).
The activities interact with the user, they present a window and present an interactive
UI inside (this is done through the function setContentView() ). Activities are typically
full-screen or also as a floating screen. They have their own cycle, and are pilled within
a stack of Activities handle by the operative system.
